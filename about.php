                    <p class="para">Hexraa is a Indian company started in December 2019 by industry veterans and is a
                        privately owned
                        and operated Private Limited Company. <br>

                        We started Hexraa because we realized web hosting had become a hodge-podge of differing control
                        panels among providers that offer web hosting.<br>

                        Our goal is to offer one central resource for high-performance web hosting and provide choices
                        for industry-recognized control panels along with premium, industry-leading features all at
                        pricing that is sustainable.<br>

                        We offer a wide range of hosting plans and multiple control panels to fit the needs of most
                        clients and businesses.</p>
